      <div class="accordeon-content">
        <ul><li><span class="translated-text">
          Each 1.0 is 10% win rate, so a 5.6 score will be predicted to win at 56% chance.
          For individual scores they are a difference either from 5.0 (ex. solo scores), or from the current score (ex. alternative champion picks), depending on the context.

          The AI was only trained on (millions of) <span class="faq-highlight">ranked</span> solo and flex games.
          Scores for game modes other than solo/flex queue will be less accurate, and should be used with a grain of salt.

      <div class="accordeon-title settings-sub-title">Why do I have a bad individual score when I have great winrate?</div>
      <div class="accordeon-content">
        <ul><li><span class="translated-text">
          The AI is aware of the winrate, but it also looks at many more things around your performance in game.
          Maybe you have climbed to a new elo in which however you are playing is no longer good enough to continue climbing.
          The opposite is also true where you some players may have bad winrates but high scores.

      <div class="accordeon-title settings-sub-title">How reliable are the scores?</div>
      <div class="accordeon-content">
        <ul><li><span class="translated-text">
          The AI doesn't just predict who will win, but gives a win chance.
          Over many games, this chance is extremely accurate, so for example exactly 60% of games where the AI said 6.0 were then actually won.
          Likewise, when the AI isn't sure, it will say values closer to 5.0.
          The overall accuracy of the AI is ~60.5%, however the accuracy for a single score is the score itself. The accuracy of 5.3 is 53%.
          It is normal that for fewer games the statistics can differ a lot in both directions, just like flipping a coin won't give you exactly 50% of each outcome.

      <div class="accordeon-content">
        <ul><li><span class="translated-text">
          This project is made by a single person with some help from others from time to time.
          I am a master elo EUW/EUNE player, who also has worked with machine learning both in the industry and the academy for over 10 years (currently working on an industrial PhD in reinforcement learning).
          This started as a tool for my own private use in 2018.
          After realizing how useful it was, I decided to share it with the community since 2020.
          I have been prioritizing the improvement of the AI above anything else, making small improvements over time.
          Feel free to reach out to me on Discord or on LinkedIn!

      <div class="accordeon-title settings-sub-title">How does the AI deal with patch changes in LoL?</div>
      <div class="accordeon-content">
        <ul><li><span class="translated-text">
          The AI is constantly training on most, if not all, ranked games - soloQ & flex, to keep up to date.
          We have observed how when new champions are released, the AI can still give a roughly accurate score for champions it has never seen in the past, 
          and the overall accuracy doesn't really drop in a noticeable manner.
          We keep updating the AI on a regular basis, to follow the small details of the patch changes.

          Please write your ideas in the discord, maybe even someone has already lifted it.<br/>
          For features related to results, generally speaking, this app will be AI based all the way, never depending on anyone's understanding of the game.
          We will not add outputs which are based on some rule of thumb on a statistic, since these can be flawed, are based on opinion, and vary over time.
          This way we ensure integrity and accuracy of results, since we can test and measure it.

          If you can help us translate to a new language or if you find issues in the current translations, please let us know on the discord.
          However, patch notes and dynamic notifications will be in English for the time being.
